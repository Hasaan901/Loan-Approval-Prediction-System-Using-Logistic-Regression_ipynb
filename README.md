Loan Approval Prediction System Using Logistic Regression

Description
This project aims to predict loan approval status based on various applicant attributes such as income, credit history, property area, and other demographic factors. The system uses a logistic regression model to classify whether a loan application will be approved (Y) or rejected (N). The dataset contains information about loan applicants, including financial and personal details, which are preprocessed and used to train the model. The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 86%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting loan approval outcomes.

Key Features
Data preprocessing to handle missing values and categorical variables.

Feature engineering to convert categorical data into numerical format.

Logistic regression model for binary classification (approved/rejected).

Evaluation of model performance using accuracy metrics.

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas (for data manipulation)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning model)

NumPy (for numerical operations)

Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization, though not extensively used in the provided code)

Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:

Loan_ID: Unique identifier for each loan application.

Gender: Applicant's gender (Male/Female).

Married: Marital status (Yes/No).

Dependents: Number of dependents.

Education: Education level (Graduate/Not Graduate).

Self_Employed: Self-employment status (Yes/No).

ApplicantIncome: Income of the applicant.

CoapplicantIncome: Income of the co-applicant.

LoanAmount: Loan amount requested.

Loan_Amount_Term: Term of the loan in days.

Credit_History: Credit history of the applicant (1 for good, 0 for bad).

Property_Area: Location of the property (Urban/Rural/Semiurban).

Loan_Status: Target variable (Y for approved, N for rejected).

How to Use
Data Preparation: Load the dataset and preprocess it by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Model Training: Split the data into training and testing sets, then train the logistic regression model.

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict loan approval status for new applicants.

Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using accuracy metrics.

Future Improvements
Experiment with other classification algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) to compare performance.

Include more features or additional data sources to improve accuracy.

Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
